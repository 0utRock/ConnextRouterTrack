Feedback : 
I'm just the beginner to start running this node. At first I just followed the guide in Medium(https://medium.com/@nizeimbaboy.2) , everything went well, until I ran into error. And since I don't have developer background. I don't know where is it went wrong and how can I fix it. Thanks to my friend Artun#0174, she help and guide me and a group of people to successfully complete this task. 
I think it would be nice, if we can keep record of frequently problems that people might face during the task. Therefore, it will be a complete step by step and guidelines for everyone who want to start.
