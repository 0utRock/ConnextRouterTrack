  - I tried out a few transactions across all 3 chains.

  A few comments:

  - I am really glad that the amarok version came out. I had been trying to spin up my router since november with previous releases
    and this new version made it way easier for me.
    
  - The official guide could be a bit more precise sometimes.
    For example by mentioning that some settings like logdnakey are optional for a first run.
    
  - I have been able to provide liquidity only through the coinhippo UI.
    The write section of smart contracts on etherscan didn't show addLiquidityFor.
    
  - I wanted to be proactive and add the Goerli chain.
    As mentioned by my fellow colleagues in the channel, transactions are sometimes stuck.
    
  - I was also looking if paid fees would be sent to the recipient address that I created (0xbb9dadcc8f205e742fa604aa7fa4dea7aecfd023) but nothing shows.
    I'll just learn about this in the near future I guess :)


2)  Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

  - Spinning up a router on the testnet with minimum liveness requirements, and participating in any network-wide testing.
    All the way.

  - Creating and improving docs and guides (in the form of text, video, or other).
    Would be glad to translate, also on request.

  - Provide feedback and create improvement proposals.
    Also all the way.

  - Building high impact tools to improve the RX.
    To the extend of my skills, with all my motivation.

  - Running extra infrastructure that benefits Connect (ex: Graph Indexers).
    Not my priority, but if needed, why not.

  - Mentoring & support.
    I can also interact with French and Spanish speaking colleagues.



3)  Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel

   -  I made friends in particular with Siwat#7738. We've been giving out each other some insights through DM.
      Other than that for now, I thank my fellow router applicants for the help they provided me. I'll help them in return as soon as I get the opportunity.
