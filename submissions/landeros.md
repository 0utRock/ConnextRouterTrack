2) Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program

    - I want to create a guide in my native language, post it on my twitter and post it on discord for other members.

    - If possible, I will try to help other participants with the installation and configuration of the router.

    - I also plan to launch additional infrastructure, such as graph indexers.

3) Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel

    - This week I helped the participants with the installation in the profile discords, next week I will try to devote more time to the main discord of the project.

4) Proposals: Adding more networks to test, for example, you can add Ropsten network.
