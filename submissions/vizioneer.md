Feedback:
  - Everything went well, but judging by the discord chat, not everyone is like that, so I decided to make a detailed guide

2.Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
  - I plan to make a video guide on how to connect a router and back it up with an article

3.Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel
