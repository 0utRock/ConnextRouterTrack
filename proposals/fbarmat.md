# Router Track Proposal

1. I propose to build a tool, a web app with nodeJs/React that runs localhost, that would help the routers operators to configure the router and do changes with a ui.
The idea is to read the config.json and then allows you to do changes to the config (add/remove/update assets, add/remove chains, change the RPC urls, etc) within a ui.
